# Barcode Scanner using VisionKit and SwiftUI

## Overview
This project is a **Barcode Scanner** application built with **Apple's VisionKit** and **SwiftUI**. It utilizes VisionKitâ€™s powerful machine learning capabilities to detect and read barcodes from live camera feeds or static images. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for scanning barcodes and displaying relevant information in real time.

## Features
- **Real-Time Barcode Scanning**: Leverages VisionKit to scan barcodes using the device's camera.
- **SwiftUI Interface**: The entire UI is built using SwiftUI, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Supports Multiple Barcode Formats**: The app can detect a variety of barcode types, including:
  - QR codes
  - UPC
  - EAN
  - Code 128
  - Data Matrix
  - PDF417
- **Instant Feedback**: As soon as a barcode is recognized, its data is displayed on the screen.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easy to integrate into existing SwiftUI projects.

## How it Works
1. **Camera Access**: The app requests permission to access the device's camera to scan barcodes in real time.
2. **VisionKit Barcode Detection**: VisionKit is used to detect barcodes using the live camera feed.
3. **Barcode Data Display**: Once a barcode is detected, its data (e.g., numeric code, product information) is displayed immediately on the screen.
4. **SwiftUI for UI Updates**: The app uses SwiftUI for its interface, ensuring real-time UI updates as barcode data is captured.

## Requirements
- **Xcode 12 or later**
- **iOS 14 or later**
- **Swift 5**
- **VisionKit Framework**
